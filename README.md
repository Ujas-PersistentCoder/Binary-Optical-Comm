# Binary-Optical-Comm
A course project on optical communication using Arduino. The system transmits a binary-encoded message via LEDs, which is received by LDR sensors and decoded back into the original message. Demonstrates basic principles of data encoding, transmission, and signal decoding using light-based media.
